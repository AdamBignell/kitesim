repo scaffolding
this repo is initialized for an ai coding agent (“jules”). code comes later; for now, only docs.

read primary-prompt.md first.
do work inside agent-workspace/.
workflow
set current focus in agent-workspace/core-task.md
plan in todo.md, log in changelog.md, capture learnings in reflections.md
every decision → decisions.md (with rationale)
unanswered items → questions.md
keep primary-prompt.md aligned with reality
