primary prompt / north star
last updated: 2025-09-13

this file is the single source of truth. re-read it before any task. do not begin implementation work until the placeholder below is replaced by the user.

prime vision (placeholder)
this section intentionally contains a thorough placeholder so work can begin on scaffolding without the final vision. update this when the user supplies their plan; all downstream tasks must realign accordingly.

mission: tbd — succinct one-liner of what we’re building and why.
target users: tbd — who benefits, primary personas.
value proposition: tbd — key outcomes/advantages vs alternatives.
north-star metric(s): tbd — how success is measured.
mvp scope: tbd — smallest coherent slice to validate value.
out of scope (non-goals): tbd — important “won’t do” list.
constraints: tbd — tech, budget, timeline, compliance, ux.
principles: tbd — decision heuristics (e.g., simplicity > features).
quality bar: tbd — perf, reliability, accessibility, docs.
review cadence: tbd — how often to checkpoint with the user.
guardrails & constraints (to be updated by user or via decisions.md)
